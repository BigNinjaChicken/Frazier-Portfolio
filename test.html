            <h2>Meet my fifth bulldog!</h2>
            <p class="product-text">&emsp;This is a very long description, which describes the origins of my fifth bulldog. It was a dark, stormy night when my fifth bulldog came to me. I sat inside in my rocking chair, listening to the wind howl, when I heard a different, faint howl outside my door. Unbeknownst to me, my fifth bulldog was waiting for me on my front porch. I let him inside, and we have been best friends since.</p>

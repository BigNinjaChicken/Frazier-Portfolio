			&emsp;For Midnight Heist I was the Modeler, Level Designer, and Project Lead. 
			There was three other people who worked on the project; two for programing and one for UIX.
			Midnight Heist was accepted and released on to Minecraft realms in 2020 for the world to play.

			<h2>Making The Game</h2>
			<p class="product-text">
			&emsp;Midnight Heist consists of two teams, Theifs and Guards. 
			As the guard, it's your job to capture the thieves before they steal everything in the museum.
			And as the Theif, you want to use your arsenal of tools and lots of teamwork to steal everything without getting caught by the guards and before reinforcements arrive.
